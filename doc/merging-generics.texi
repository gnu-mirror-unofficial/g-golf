In G-Golf, generic functions are always merged (@pxref{Merging
Generics,,, guile, The GNU Guile Reference Manual}).

Users are (highly) recommended to do the same, in their @code{repl},
application/library modules and script(s). In its modules - those that
import (oop goops) - G-Golf uses the following duplicate binding handler
set:

@example
  #:duplicates (merge-generics
		replace
		warn-override-core
		warn
		last)
@end example

In a @code{repl} or in scripts, these maybe set - after importing (oop
goops) - by calling @code{default-duplicate-binding-handler}:


@example
(use-modules (oop goops))

(default-duplicate-binding-handler
    '(merge-generics replace warn-override-core warn last))
@end example

G-Golf regular users should consider adding the above lines to their
@file{$HOME/.guile} or, when working in a multi-user environmet, should
consider adding those lines the file named @file{init.scm} in the
so-called Guile global site directory@footnote{You need write privileges
to add or modify this file, contact your system administrator if you're
not in charge of the system you are working on.}, here (evaluate the
following expression in a terminal): @code{guile -c "(display
(%global-site-dir))(newline)"}.
