@node Working with GNOME
@section Working with GNOME

Working with GNOME exposes, grouped by theme, the user interfaces to
import and work with GObject-Introspectable GNOME libraries.

Please note that within the scope of the G-Golf manual in general, in
the sections presented here in particular, we simply (as in merely and
in the simplest possible way) exposes the scheme representation and
G-Golf interfaces of the elements that are being addressed. For a
deep(er) understanding of the original concepts, components and
interfaces, you must refer to the upstream library documentation itself.

This is particularly true for the GLib Object System related
sections. For a thorough understanding of the GLib Object System - its
background, design goals, dynamic type system, base class instantiation,
memory management, properties, closures and signals messaging system -
please consult the @uref{@value{UGOBJECT-Concepts}, GObject - Part
I. Concepts} of the GObject reference manual.

@c Note that this not, and by no means, a description
