G-Golf GObject Introspection modules are defined in the @code{gi}
subdirectory, such as @code{(g-golf gi repository)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf GObject Introspection is to import the @code{g-golf} module,
which imports and re-exports the public interface of all modules used
and defined by G-Golf (for a complete list, visit its source
definition):

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf))
@end lisp

Most G-Golf GObject Introspection modules correspond to a GObject
Intropection (manual) section, but there are some exceptions, such as
@code{init} and @code{utils} @dots{}
