G-Golf GObject Introspection modules are defined in the @code{gi}
subdirectory, such as @code{(g-golf gi repository)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf is to import the @code{g-golf} module: it imports and re-exports
the public interface of (oop goops), (ice-9 match), (ice-9
binary-ports), (rnrs bytevectors), (rnrs arithmetic bitwise), (system
foreign), all G-Golf support, Glib, GObject and GObject
Introspection modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf))
@end lisp

Most G-Golf low level API modules correspond to a GObject Intropection
section, but there are some exceptions, such as @code{init} and
@code{utils} @dots{}
