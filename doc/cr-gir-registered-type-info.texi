@subheading Description

@code{GIRegisteredTypeInfo} represents an entity with a @code{GType}
associated. Could be either a @code{GIEnumInfo}, @code{GIInterfaceInfo},
@code{GIObjectInfo}, @code{GIStructInfo} or a @code{GIUnionInfo}.

A registered type info struct has a name and a type function.


@subheading Procedures

Note: in this section, the @var{info} argument is [must be] a pointer to
a @code{GIRegisteredTypeInfo}.


@anchor{g-registered-type-info-get-type-name}
@deffn Procedure g-registered-type-info-get-type-name info

Returns the type name.

Obtain the type name of the struct within the GObject type system. This
type can be passed to g_type_name() to get a GType.
@end deffn


@anchor{g-registered-type-info-get-type-init}
@deffn Procedure g-registered-type-info-get-type-init info

Returns the name of the type init function.

Obtain the type init function for @var{info}. The type init function is
the function which will register the @code{GType} within the
@code{GObject} type system. Usually this is not called by langauge
bindings or applications.
@end deffn


@anchor{g-registered-type-info-get-g-type}
@deffn Procedure g-registered-type-info-get-g-type info

Returns the @code{GType} for @var{info}.

Obtain the @code{GType} for this registered type or @code{G_TYPE_NONE}
which has a special meaning.  It means that either there is no type
information associated with this info or that the shared library which
provides the type_init function for this info cannot be called.
