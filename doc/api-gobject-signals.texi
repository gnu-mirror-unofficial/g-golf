@subheading Description

The basic concept of the signal system is that of the emission of a
signal. Signals are introduced per-type and are identified through
strings. Signals introduced for a parent type are available in derived
types as well, so basically they are a per-type facility that is
inherited.

Please read the @uref{@value{UGOBJECT-Signals}, Signals} section from
the GObject reference manual for a complete description.

@subheading Types and Values


@anchor{%g-signal-flags}
@defivar <gi-enum> %g-signal-flags

The signal flags are used to specify a signal's behaviour, the overall
signal description outlines how especially the RUN flags control the
stages of a signal emission.

An instance of @code{<gi-enum>}, who's members are the scheme
representation of the @code{GSignalFlags}:

@indentedblock
@emph{gi-name}: GSignalFlags  @*
@emph{scm-name}: g-signal-flags  @*
@emph{enum-set}:
@indentedblock
@table @code

@item run-first
nvoke the object method handler in the first emission stage.

@item run-last
Invoke the object method handler in the third emission stage.

@item run-cleanup
Invoke the object method handler in the last emission stage.

@item no-recurse
Signals being emitted for an object while currently being in emission
for this very object will not be emitted recursively, but instead cause
the first emission to be restarted.

@item detailed
This signal supports "::detail" appendices to the signal name upon
handler connections and emissions.

@item action
Action signals are signals that may freely be emitted on alive objects
from user code via @code{g-signal-emit} and friends, without the need of
being embedded into extra code that performs pre or post emission
adjustments on the object. They can also be thought of as object methods
which can be called generically by third-party code.

@item no-hooks
No emissions hooks are supported for this signal.

@item must-collect
Varargs signal emission will always collect the arguments, even if there
are no signal handlers connected. Since 2.30.

@item deprecated
The signal is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. A
warning will be generated if it is connected while running with
@code{G_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC=1}. Since 2.32.
