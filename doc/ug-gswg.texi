G-Golf will let you import and work with any GObject-Introspectable
GNOME library@footnote{In its compiled form, a GObject-Introspectable
GNOME library is called a @uref{@value{UGI-OVERVIEW}, Typelib} - a
binary, readonly, memory-mappable database containing reflective
information about a GObject library.}. Since we need to make a choice
among so many, to guide new comers and get them started with G-Golf,
let's pick-up @uref{@value{UGTK}, Gtk}, and show how to
@uref{@value{UGTK-WEB}, Create interfaces that users just love}.

Following the tradition, we will first look at the often seen
@samp{Hello World!} familiar, friendly greeting program.

We will continue with a section on @samp{Scripting} (also @pxref{Guile
Scripting,,, guile, The GNU Guile Reference Manual}), keeping the fun,
revisiting our @samp{Hello World!} code, maybe some other example(s),
exploring a few more @uref{@value{UGTK}, Gtk} widgets.

To complete the section, we will walk you through the necessary and/or
recommended steps to build applications,
