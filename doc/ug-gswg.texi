G-Golf will let you import and work with any GObject-Introspectable
GNOME library, called @code{Typelib}@footnote{A @code{Typelib} is a
binary, readonly, memory-mappable database containing reflective
information about a GObject library}. Since we need to make a choice
among so many, to guide new comers and let them started with G-Golf,
let's pick-up @uref{@value{UGTK}, Gtk}, and show how to
@uref{@value{UGTK-WEB}, Create interfaces that users just love}.

Following the tradition, we will first look at and work on a couple of
versions of the often seen @samp{Hello World!} familiar, friendly
greeting program.

We will then complete the section by walking through the necessary
and/or recommended steps to build applications,
