@subheading Description

@code{GIFunctionInfo} represents a function, method or constructor. To
find out what kind of entity a GIFunctionInfo represents, call
@ref{g-golf-fi-get-flags}.

See also @ref{Callable Info} for information on how to retreive
arguments and other metadata.


@subheading Procedures

Note: in this section, the @var{info} argument is [must be] a pointer to
a @code{GIFunctionInfo}.


@anchor{g-golf-fi-get-flags}
@deffn Procedure g-golf-fi-get-flags info

Returns a list of @ref{%g-golf-fi-flags}.

Obtain the @code{GIFunctionInfoFlags} for @var{info}.
@end deffn


@anchor{g-golf-fi-get-symbol}
@deffn Procedure g-golf-fi-get-symbol info

Returns a string.

Obtain the @samp{symbol} of the function@footnote{As you have noticed
already, since @code{g-golf-fi-get-symbol} returns a string, in the
Glib, GObject and GObject Instrospection worlds, symbol has a different
meaning then in the Lisp/Scheme worlds.  However, since the procedure is
part of the G-Golf low-level API, we decided to keep its name as close
as the original name as possible, given and keeping in mind G-Golf
@ref{Abreviations} conventions.}, which in @code{Glib} terms is the name
of the exported function, @samp{suitable to be used as an argument to
g_module_symbol()}.
@end deffn
