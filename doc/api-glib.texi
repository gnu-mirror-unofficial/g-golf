G-Golf Glib modules are defined in the @code{glib} subdirectory, such as
@code{(g-golf glib main-event-loop)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf Glib is to import its main module, which imports and re-exports
the public interface of (oop goops), (system foreign), all G-Golf
support and G-Golf Glib modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf glib))
@end lisp

G-Golf Glib low level API modules correspond to a Glib section,
though they might be some exception in the future.
