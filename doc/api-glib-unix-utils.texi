@subheading Description

Most of GLib is intended to be portable; in contrast, this set of
functions is designed for programs which explicitly target UNIX, or are
using it to build higher level abstractions which would be conditionally
compiled if the platform matches G_OS_UNIX.


@subheading Procedures

Note: in this section, the @var{fd} and @var{condition} arguments are
[must be] respectively an integer (a @samp{valid} file descriptor) and a
list of one or more @ref{%g-io-condition} flags.


@anchor{g-unix-fd-source-new}
@deffn Procedure g-unix-fd-source-new fd condition

Returns a pointer.

Creates and returns a pointer to a new @code{GSource} to watch for a
particular IO @var{condition} on @var{fd}.

The source will never close the file descriptor, you must do it
yourself.
