G-Golf Gdk modules are defined in the @code{gdk} subdirectory, such as
@code{(g-golf gdk events)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
G-Golf Gdk is to import its main module, which imports and re-exports
the public interface of (oop goops), (system foreign), all G-Golf
support and G-Golf Gdk modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf gdk))
@end lisp

G-Golf Gdk low level API modules correspond to a Gdk section, though
they might be some exception in the future.

* Events:: Functions for handling events from the window system.
