@subheading Procedures


@anchor{g-get-prgname}
@deffn Procedure g-get-prgname

Returns the name of the program, or #f if it has not been set yet.

Obtains and returns the name of the program. This name should not be
localized, in contrast to @code{g-get-application-name}.

If you are using @code{GApplication}, the program name is set in
@code{g-application-run}.

@c In case of @code{GDK} or @code{GTK+} it is set in @code{gdk-init}, which
@c is called by @code{gtk_init} and the @samp{startup} handler. The program
@c name is found by taking the last component of argv [0].
@end deffn


@anchor{g-set-prgname}
@deffn Procedure g-set-prgname name

Returns nothing.

Sets the name of the program to @var{name}. This name should not be
localized, in contrast to @code{g-set-application-name}.

If you are using @code{GApplication}, the program name is set in
@code{g-application-run}.

@c In case of @code{GDK} or @code{GTK+} it is set in @code{gdk-init}, which
@c is called by @code{gtk_init} and the @samp{startup} handler. The program
@c name is found by taking the last component of argv [0].

Note that for thread-safety reasons this function can only be called
once.
