Enumeration and Flag Types â€” Enumeration and flags types.


@subheading Description

The GLib type system provides fundamental types for enumeration and
flags types. (Flags types are like enumerations, but allow their values
to be combined by bitwise or). A registered enumeration or flags type
associates a name and a nickname with each allowed value. When an
enumeration or flags type is registered with the GLib type system, it
can be used as value type for object properties.
