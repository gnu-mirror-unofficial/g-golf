G-Golf High Level API modules are defined in the @code{hl-api}
subdirectory, such as @code{(g-golf hl-api gobject)}.

Where you may load these modules individually, the easiest way to use
the G-Golf High Level API is to import the @code{hl-api} module: it
imports and re-exports the public interface of (oop goops), some G-Golf
support modules and all G-Golf High Level API modules:

@lisp
(use-modules (g-golf hl-api))
@end lisp

As stated in the introduction, G-Golf high level API (main) objective is
to make (imported) GOBject classes and methods available using GOOPS,
the Guile Object Oriented System (@pxref{GOOPS,,, guile, The GNU Guile
Reference Manual}), in a way that is largely inspired by
@uref{@value{UGG}, Guile-Gnome}.

@c Unlike Guile-Gnome though, G-Golf won't register new GObject subclasses,
@c at least not in its first version, in an attempt to allow and @samp{play
@c with} multiple inheritance.
