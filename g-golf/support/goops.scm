;; define-method* has been written by Mark H Weaver, I just changed
;; let-values -> receive, which I find (a lot) more readable. I can't
;; point to 'an original definition location' though, because Mark
;; pasted his definition while chating on #guile, a few years ago.  I
;; don't think Mark ever published this code anywhere, but I could be
;; wrong, if that is the case, please let me know, I'd be happy to add
;; the link here.
