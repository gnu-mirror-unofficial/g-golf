;; Although I would have used this definitin, I sort of accidentally
;; import selectively the GIOCondition dfinition from the GLib typelib,
;; and to my surprise, they use different enum-set integer values, see
;; below. A few tests show it doesn't make any difference (my bitwise
;; combination (mental) skills are missing at this moment :-()), but I
;; decided to keep the 'imported' enum-set definition anyway.
